The Quantum Encryption Device (QED) - 30-Day Evaluation Version.

Revolutionary quantum encryption technology that provides hardware-entangled
cryptographic security by binding encryption keys to specific CPU frequency
signatures and RAM configurations.

This is a LIMITED 30-DAY EVALUATION VERSION with full functionality but
time-based expiry. Commercial licenses available for $2,000 (binaries) or
$25,000 (full source code with development rights).

For commercial licensing contact: amexsimoes@gmail.com

Features in this evaluation:
- Hardware-bound quantum encryption
- CPU frequency signature binding
- RAM configuration entanglement
- AES-256 quantum-enhanced encryption
- File encryption/decryption with quantum signatures
- Command-line interface
- 30-day evaluation period
- License compliance checks
