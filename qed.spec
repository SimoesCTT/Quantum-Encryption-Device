%description
The Quantum Encryption Device (QED) is a revolutionary cryptographic system 
that achieves quantum-like entanglement effects between files and hardware. 
Unlike traditional encryption, QED-encrypted files can ONLY be decrypted on 
the exact same hardware that encrypted them.

Key Features:
- Hardware-dependent key generation using CPU frequency and RAM signatures
- AES-256 encryption with quantum signatures for tamper detection
- Anti-theft protection - files become useless on different hardware
- Professional C implementation with CLI and library support
