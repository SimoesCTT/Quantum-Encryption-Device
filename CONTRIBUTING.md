# Contributing to Quantum Encryption Device (QED)

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Quantum Encryption Device! We welcome contributions from the community to help improve and expand this revolutionary cryptographic system.

## 📋 Before You Start

**Important**: This is a proprietary software project with specific licensing terms. By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be subject to the project's proprietary license.

### Code of Conduct
- Be respectful and inclusive
- Focus on constructive feedback
- Help maintain a professional environment
- Respect proprietary nature of the codebase

## 🔧 Development Setup

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Install dependencies (Fedora/RHEL)
sudo dnf install gcc openssl-devel make git

# Install dependencies (Ubuntu/Debian)
sudo apt install gcc libssl-dev make git
```

### Getting Started
```bash
# Clone the repository (with proper access)
git clone https://github.com/SimoesCTT/Quantum-Encryption-Device.git
cd Quantum-Encryption-Device

# Check dependencies
make deps

# Build debug version
make debug

# Run tests
make test
```

## 🚀 How to Contribute

### 1. Issues and Bug Reports
- Check existing issues before creating new ones
- Use the appropriate issue templates
- Provide detailed reproduction steps
- Include system information (OS, GCC version, etc.)

### 2. Feature Requests  
- Clearly describe the proposed feature
- Explain the use case and benefits
- Consider security and licensing implications
- Discuss implementation approach

### 3. Code Contributions

#### Pull Request Process
1. Fork the repository (if you have access)
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`
3. Make your changes following coding standards
4. Test thoroughly: `make test`
5. Commit with descriptive messages
6. Push to your branch: `git push origin feature/amazing-feature`
7. Open a Pull Request with detailed description

#### Coding Standards
- Follow existing code style and conventions
- Use clear, descriptive variable and function names
- Add comments for complex algorithms
- Include proper error handling
- Maintain security best practices

```c
// Good example
qed_result_t qed_encrypt_data(const uint8_t *plaintext, size_t len, 
                             uint8_t **ciphertext, size_t *cipher_len) {
    if (!plaintext || !ciphertext || !cipher_len || len == 0) {
        return QED_ERROR_INVALID_INPUT;
    }
    
    // Implementation...
}
```

### 4. Documentation
- Update README.md for user-facing changes
- Add API documentation for new functions
- Include code examples where appropriate
- Update build instructions if needed

### 5. Testing
- Add unit tests for new functionality
- Test on multiple Linux distributions
- Verify hardware compatibility
- Check for memory leaks with valgrind

```bash
# Example testing
valgrind --leak-check=full ./bin/qed --encrypt test.txt --output test.qed
```

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Responsible Disclosure
- Report security vulnerabilities privately to security@quantumencryption.dev
- Allow reasonable time for fixes before public disclosure
- Do not exploit vulnerabilities or access unauthorized data

### Code Security
- Never commit sensitive data (keys, passwords, etc.)
- Use secure coding practices
- Validate all inputs thoroughly
- Clear sensitive memory after use
